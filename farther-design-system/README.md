# Farther Design System

> The Intelligent Wealth Platform — built from the ground up to unlock greater
> wealth for clients throughout their financial lives.

Farther is a wealth-management company and technology platform. Its product
serves two audiences:

- **Modern Wealth Builders** — HNW/UHNW individuals ($1M–$10M+ investable
  assets) who want growth, clarity, and one unified financial picture instead
  of fragmented accounts.
- **Elite Advisors** — high-performing RIAs and breakaway brokers
  ($50M–$500M+ AUM) who want to scale their book without the administrative
  drag of legacy tech.

The category Farther owns is **Intelligent Wealth** — expert advisors fused
with native, AI-driven technology. The brand deliberately sits in the
"winning quadrant": high benefit to both clients and advisors, and built
ground-up rather than retrofitted onto legacy systems.

This design system is the canonical kit for designing anything Farther —
product UI, marketing site, decks, social, stationery. Everything lives at
the **root** of this project; ui_kits/, slides/, preview/, and assets/
hang off it.

## Content fundamentals

The Farther brand voice is **Proactive, Precise, Empowering**. It speaks
with the clarity of a tech innovator and the conviction of a trusted partner.

**Five "we are, but not…" dials:**

1. **Visionary, but not idealistic.** Forward-thinking, grounded in data and
   mechanics. Say "Our platform builds optimized roadmaps that evolve as your
   life evolves" — not "Imagine a world where financial freedom is effortless."
2. **Precise, but not cold.** Outcome-focused, human-centered, no jargon.
   Say "We use direct indexing and asset location to optimize your portfolio's
   tax efficiency" — not "We leverage algorithms to optimize your alpha
   coefficient."
3. **Candid, but not combative.** Direct and confident without attacking
   competitors. Say "By automating complex strategies that others often miss,
   clients can gain up to 1–3% greater after-tax returns" — not "Stop losing
   money with outdated advisors."
4. **Accessible, but not simplistic.** Respect the audience's intelligence.
   Say "We provide exclusive access to top-tier investment strategies
   typically reserved for family offices" — not "We make investing super easy."
5. **Grounded, but not nostalgic.** Credibility comes from substantiated
   outcomes, not legacy-bank nostalgia. Cite numbers (4x AUM growth, 1–3%
   after-tax lift) over "bespoke white-glove stewardship."

**Second person.** Copy addresses the reader as "you" — "Know exactly where
you stand, at all times." Farther says "we" when describing the firm. Never
"our customers" or "our partners."

**Casing & punctuation.** Strict rules from the guidelines:

- **Sentence case throughout.** Title Case only for data viz, tables,
  reports.
- **No period on single-sentence headlines.** Multiple sentences keep their
  periods.
- **"and" not "&"** wherever space allows.
- **Oxford commas.** Always.
- **Em dash with spaces** for emphasis: "Modern, but rooted — innovative,
  but reliable."
- **En dash without spaces** for number ranges: 2024–2026, 1–3%, $1M–10M+.
- **Numeric abbreviations:** 7B+, $84T–$124T, 4.6k — never "Trillion,"
  "Billion," "thousand."
- **Hanging punctuation** for inline quotes, numbered lists, and bullets.

**Vocabulary.**

- Category: "Intelligent Wealth Management" (never plain "wealth management").
- Product: "Intelligent Wealth Platform" (capitalized).
- Platform qualifiers (use): **Native, Unified, Proactive, Precise, Active**.
  Avoid: Revolutionary, Disruptive, Advanced.
- Clients: "Modern wealth builders" — never "HNW individuals," "customers,"
  "users."
- Advisors: "Elite advisors" or "expert advisors" — never "FAs," "our
  partners."

**Emoji.** Not used. The brand is premium-but-not-gatekept; emoji feel
consumer-casual and off-tone. Icons from the line-drawing system and the
F-symbol do the expressive work.

**Example one-liners** (pulled from the Sample Copy page):

- "Built for greater wealth"
- "Complexity, clarified"
- "Action over admin"
- "Unified financial ecosystem, total financial clarity"
- "Unlock your full financial potential"

## Visual foundations

### Color

Three tiers — **Primary** does the heavy lifting, **Secondary** adds variety,
**Accent** is used sparingly (especially in charts).

**Primary.**

- **Limestone 50** `#F8F4F0` — dominant warm-neutral background. "Soft and
  grounded… calm simplicity and effortless natural refinement."
- **Charcoal Black 900** `#333333` — primary text and high-contrast surfaces.
  "Quiet confidence, balancing strength and sophistication." Never use pure
  `#000`.
- **Clay 400** `#9F8E75` — warm earth tone for graphic elements and the Waves
  of Wealth gradient. Fails AA for body copy — only use at large sizes or as
  a surface.
- **White** `#FFFFFF` — secondary background, cards, and high-contrast pops.

**Secondary (cool, trust-signalling blues).**

- **Steel Blue 700** `#3B5A69` — **wordmark lock color** and primary brand
  blue. Depth, trust, refined determination.
- **Granite Blue 800** `#31465C` — deepest blue for enduring strength.
- **Slate Blue 500** `#5B6A71` — cool neutral, subtle and discreet.
- **Smalt Blue 500** `#557A89` — crisp focus, modern capability.
- **Sky Blue 300** `#B6D0ED` — optimistic lightness, used on lighter
  surfaces.

**Accent (reserved, mostly for charting).**

- **Pomegranate 500** `#CE3657` — urgency and negative chart values.
- **Serene Aqua 500** `#3CC1D3` — positive data points, moments of clarity.
- **Bronze 400** `#B68A4C` — the most reserved color; used for the custom
  line-drawing icons, special invitations, and stationery only.

All full scales (25/50/100/…/900) are in `colors_and_type.css`.

**Color ratio.** Roughly 70% primary (Limestone + Charcoal dominant), 25%
secondary (Steel/Slate/Smalt/Granite), 5% accent.

**Accessibility.** Charcoal-on-Limestone is the workhorse pairing (contrast
11.5). Never use Charcoal on Clay for small text (3.97 → AA large only,
FAIL for body).

### Typography

**Brand fonts** (external-facing product, site, decks):

- **ABC Arizona Text** (Display, serif) — Headlines, titles, numbers. Sharp
  serifs with soft flares, humanist, "historically rooted and visually
  novel." Weights: Light / Regular / Medium / Bold. Used at 110% leading,
  -3% tracking, sentence case.
- **Fakt Pro** (Sans, grotesque/geometric) — Body, subheads, eyebrows, CTAs.
  Weights: Blonde / Normal / Medium / Semibold / Bold.

**House fonts** (internal documents only — memos, letters):

- **Garamond (EB Garamond)** — primary.
- **Avenir** — secondary.

**Type hierarchy** (exact settings from the guidelines):

| Style | Face | Leading | Tracking | Case | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Eyebrow | Fakt | 120% | +5% | UPPER | "SUMMARY" |
| Headline / Title | Arizona Text | 110% | −3% | Sentence | No terminal period (unless multi-sentence) |
| Subhead | Fakt Normal | 110% | −2% | Sentence | |
| Body | Fakt Normal | 140% | −3% | Sentence | |
| Numbers | Arizona Text Light | 100% | −3% | Sentence | Big stat treatment |
| CTA / Tag | Fakt Regular | 100% | −2% | Sentence | |

> **Font status.** Licensed and live in `fonts/`:
>
> - **ABC Arizona Text** — Light (300) + Light Italic (300, italic)
> - **Fakt Pro** — Blonde 300, Normal 400, Medium 500, Semibold 600, Bold 700 — each with matching italics
>
> Every headline, body line, button, and eyebrow across this kit now renders
> in the real brand fonts.
>
> Still substituted (narrow use):
>
> - **Arizona Text Regular/Medium/Bold** → **Fraunces** (only hit if a
>   heavier serif is explicitly requested — the brand almost always uses Light)
> - **Garamond / Avenir** (house fonts, internal-only) → EB Garamond / Nunito Sans

### Spacing, radii, elevation

The guidelines don't define an explicit spacing token scale; I've proposed a
4-point system (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128) that matches the
quiet, grid-based layout used across the brand PDFs.

- **Radii:** small (4–6), medium (10–12), and **pill** (9999) for CTAs.
  Cards typically use 12–16. The symbol's container square uses 12.
- **Borders:** Hairline `1px solid #E3D3C5` (Limestone 200) on Limestone
  backgrounds; `1px solid #E7E7E7` (Charcoal 100) on white.
- **Shadows:** The brand is mostly flat. When elevation is needed it's a
  soft, low-opacity drop in a warm tint:
  `0 1px 2px rgba(51,51,51,0.04), 0 8px 24px rgba(51,51,51,0.06)`.
  No glows, no neon, no inner shadows.

### Backgrounds, surfaces, texture

- **Default canvas** is Limestone 50 (`#F8F4F0`), not white. White is
  reserved for cards on Limestone, or for all-white "clarity" product
  moments.
- **Waves of Wealth** — the signature motion graphic: flowing horizontal
  bands that start in a deep Steel/Granite Blue and resolve into Clay/Bronze
  gradients. Used for homepage hero backgrounds and large brand moments.
  Static CSS recreation in `preview/Background-Waves.html`.
- **Frosted glass** — soft, elevated surfaces used as dividers and floating
  panels. Implemented as `backdrop-filter: blur(24px)` over Limestone,
  with a 1px Limestone-200 hairline.
- **Ellipse imagery** — out-of-focus warm-neutral blobs
  (`assets/misc/ellipse-*.png`) — used as ambient backdrops behind avatars
  or stats.

### Imagery

- **Modern families** — aspirational, elevated, contemporary. Covers a range
  of demographics, age brackets, and locations. Warm, natural light; never
  corporate stock.
- **Client-advisor moments** — authentic, intimate, beyond a typical office.
- **Advisor portraits** — artful, not corporate head shots; show nuance and
  personalization.
- **Lifestyle** — aspirational but believable.

No images ship in this kit. When producing designs, use neutral warm
placeholders (Limestone/Clay tones) or ask for the Farther image library.

### Iconography

Two parallel icon systems. See `ICONOGRAPHY` below.

### Motion & interaction

- **Motion metaphor:** "Waves of Wealth" — steady, reliable growth. Easing
  is `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` (ease-out-quint), calm and confident —
  never bouncy.
- **Hover:** primary buttons darken (to Steel Blue 800). Secondary buttons
  fill with a 6% Charcoal overlay. Link hover: opacity 1 with a 1px
  underline appearing.
- **Press:** subtle `translateY(1px)` + darker fill; no shrink/bounce.
- **Transitions:** default 160ms ease-out for color/opacity, 240ms for
  size/position. No long flashy animations in product UI.
- **Blur & transparency:** used for elevated panels (frosted glass) and
  sometimes in charts (gauge rings fade to 50% opacity). Avoid decorative
  translucency on text.

### Layout rules

- Generous whitespace; the PDFs use page-width-sized negative space as a
  design element.
- Fixed marketing-site header; sticky product-app top bar.
- **Footer** uses Charcoal 900 with Limestone 50 text.
- Never use rounded-corners-with-left-color-accent cards (AI trope). Cards
  are either all-white with a hairline, or frosted glass.
- Pie/donut charts consistently use the **Steel Blue / Granite Blue / Smalt
  / Sky Blue** family for segmentation.

## Iconography

Farther uses **two distinct icon systems**:

### 1. Brand symbol family

31 hand-made variants of the **F-symbol** live in `assets/icons/symbol-*.svg`.
These are all derivatives of the wordmark's "F" with trailing strokes that
build the brand's growth-and-expansion story. They are **brand marks, not
UI icons** — use them for:

- Avatar/favicon-style brand moments
- Decorative section dividers
- Hero graphics and loading placeholders
- Social post templates

**Do not** use them in buttons or as inline status icons.

### 2. Line-drawing UI/diagram icons

The guidelines define a **custom conceptual icon family** with these
construction rules:

- 50×50 artboard, content centered
- ~1pt stroke, **rounded endpoints, rounded joins**
- Slight corner radius after construction
- **Rendered in Bronze 400 (`#B68A4C`)** when used in diagrams

No SVG sources of this library were included in the uploads. Until the
library lands, this kit **substitutes [Lucide](https://lucide.dev)** — 1pt
stroke, rounded line-cap/join, matching visual weight. Lucide is loaded via
CDN in every page that needs icons:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/lucide@latest"></script>
<i data-lucide="trending-up"></i>
<script>lucide.createIcons();</script>
```

When the Farther icon library becomes available, drop the SVGs into
`assets/icons/diagrams/` and the UI components will read from there first.

**Emoji** — never used in brand materials.

**Unicode as icons** — the brand occasionally uses the em-dash (—) as a
connective glyph, and the degree-of-motion arrow (→, ↗) in stat tiles.
Otherwise, no.

## Iterating on this kit

Things that would tighten this kit a lot, if you can share them:

1. **Licensed Arizona Text + Fakt Pro font files** (right now everything
   renders in Google-Fonts substitutes).
2. **The farther.com codebase, or a Figma link** — the current UI kits are
   reconstructed from the PDFs; code or Figma would let us match real
   components pixel-perfectly.
3. **The custom line-drawing icon library** (the Bronze-rendered set
   described in `Farther-7.pdf`).
4. **Photography** — any brand-approved modern-families, advisor-portrait,
   or lifestyle imagery.
